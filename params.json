{"name":"Zombielab","tagline":"Prototype for ZombieLab game","body":"### More updates coming in, graphics & more\r\nRooms, walls and doors now have their graphics. There's still lots of work needed to put stuff inside the rooms so that each type of the room is recognizable, but we have a good start now.\r\nNew stuff, like access cards, fire, explosives barrels and flashlights were added to the game. Same as with graphics - that's far from complete list of features, but you will have a better feel of how this game plays out.\r\n\r\nLatest version is available at: [http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/stable/](http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/stable/)\r\n\r\n### Milestone reached\r\nAll the core components for the game are now in. We have items, different room types, zombie spawners and even a tutorial.\r\nThere's still lots of work to be done (game balance, random events, items, performance improvements etc.), but it's time to reach out and get some help to replace this excuse of graphics with [hopefully] something very plausible.\r\n\r\nAlso, from now on I'll be keeping a more stable version in a separate location, with most recent dev version available at the usual location.\r\n\r\nLatest [stable] version is available at: [http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/stable/](http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/stable/)\r\n\r\nLatest screenshot:\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/g2y4jPP.png)\r\n\r\n### Going strong\r\nBeen a little while since I've updated this log, but it was still really busy in here. The latest version has lots of improvements, starting with items that actually work, skills that actually affect your performance, information windows (hold tap/mouse to show character/item info), animations, performance improvements and lots more.\r\n\r\nThe latest is available at: [http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/](http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/)\r\n\r\n### More changes coming in\r\nProject's going strong, we some new features already implemented. Team members are getting more varied - with gear and skills. Inventory management works, you can swap items around and force a reload on a weapon. Skills and other items still need to be implemented, but we're getting there. And fast.\r\n\r\nYou can check out the latest at [http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/](http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/)\r\n\r\n### Latest version available online\r\nAfter some more work, we have walking zombies, Game Overs and option to actually beat the levels. Still miles to go and current state doesn't really resemble the final gameplay, but you can check it out online nonetheless. Latest build is available at:\r\n[http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/#/game](http://ethnar.com/Zombielab/#/game)\r\n\r\n### Welcome to ZombieLab\r\nThe website is about a new game in works called (temporarily?) ZombieLab.\r\nThe game is a dungeon crawler with some RPG elements, primarily targeted for mobile devices. Top-down view, very simple graphics, engaging gameplay - that's the goal.\r\nThere'll be more info coming soon, for now just a screenshot of (never seen before! ;)) very-pre-alpha version:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/WaVmbEC.png)","google":"UA-67904301-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
